🚀 Kanban Task Management System | MERN Stack
A Professional Project Management Solution for Remote Teams
This application serves as a full-featured, secure, and intuitive Kanban board solution, designed to improve team collaboration and project transparency. It allows users to break down large projects into manageable tasks, track progress across defined stages, and visualize workflows in real-time.

✨ Key Features (Planned)
We will implement the following features over the next few weeks:

- Secure Authentication: User registration, login, and protected routes using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- Role-Based Access: Different permissions for project owners and team members.
- Dynamic Kanban Board: Create, edit, and delete projects (Boards).
- Drag-and-Drop Tasks: Seamlessly move tasks (Cards) between columns (Lists) with real-time updates using React Beautiful DND.
- State Persistence: Tasks and project states saved immediately to MongoDB.
- User Profiles: Manage profile information and view assigned tasks.

🛠 Tech Stack
This project is built using the industry-standard MERN Stack with modern tooling for a fast, scalable, and maintainable application.
